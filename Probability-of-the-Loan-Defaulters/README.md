### Project Overview

 For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.
Problem Statement:
What is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better understanding of probability. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Independency check,
Bayes theorem,
Visualizing discrete variable,
Visualizing continuous variable.


### Challenges faced

 Getting back the formula used in some question.


### Additional pointers

 Its about understanding of probability and its utilization for solving the problem.We can use different command or instruction for selecting columns and getting there length/size.
The focus of this project is to implement probability and its theorem.

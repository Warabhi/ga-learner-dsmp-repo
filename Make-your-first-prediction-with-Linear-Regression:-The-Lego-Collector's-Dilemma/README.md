### Project Overview

 Problem statement
You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. Since (luckily!), you are a data scientist in the making, you wished to solve this problem yourself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.


### Learnings from the project

 Train-test split

Correlation between the features

Linear Regression

MSE andR^2R Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Project Overview.

Data loading and splitting.

Predictor Check!

Reduce feature redundancies!

Is my price prediction ok?

Residual check!


### Challenges faced

 Split Data into tain and test data.
Scatter_plot for different features vs target variable list_price. This tells  which features are highly correlated with the target variable list_price and help to predict it better.
Check the model accuracy using r^2 score and mse.


### Additional pointers

 
The dataset has details of 12261 lego sets with the following 10 features

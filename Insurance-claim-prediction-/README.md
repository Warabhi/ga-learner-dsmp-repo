### Project Overview

 Till now you have seen that how to solve the linear regression and regularization problem. Now in this project, you are going to predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression. This dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.


### Learnings from the project

### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Data loading and splitting |
Outlier Detection |
Correlation Check ! |
Predictor check! |
Is my Insurance claim prediction right? |
Performance of a classifier !


### Challenges faced

 Plot the box plot to check for the outlier.
pair_plot tells which features are highly correlated with the other feature and help to predict its better logistic regression model.


### Additional pointers

 
The dataset has details of 1338 Insurance claim with the following 8 features.
